XForm Fields
===========================================

An XForm is composed of one or more ordered fields.  Currently four types are supported for each field, ``integer``, ``decimal``, ``string`` and ``coordinate``.  Each field must have a unique human readable name, as well as a shorter ``slug`` used to uniquely identify it.  You may also specify help text that will be displayed in rich XForm clients.


Integer Field
--------------

An integer field which contains even numbers.

Examples::
	
	survey +age 20
	survey +height 35

Decimal Field
--------------

A decimal field holds a real, non integer number.  It has a maximum precision of 9 digits before and 9 digits after the period.

Examples::
	
	survey +flow 5.4
	survey +temp 98.6

String Field
------------

A string field, represents just a block of text.

Examples::
	
	survey +name matt berg
	survey +comment well is in need of repair

Coordinate Field
----------------

A coordinate field, which in practice is a pairing of decimal fields.

Examples::

	survey +loc 1.4564 1.5435
	survey +track 1.5456 1.2355

Image Field
------------

An image, supported by ODK Collect submissions only.  Note that you can still force this field to be required and it will just be ignored for SMS submissions.

Audio Field
------------

An audio clip, supported by ODK Collect submissions only.  Note that you can still force this field to be required and it will just be ignored for SMS submissions.

Video Field
------------

A video clip, supported by ODK Collect submissions only.  Note that you can still force this field to be required and it will just be ignored for SMS submissions.

Custom Field Types
------------------

You can also create custom field types, which can point either to your own domain objects or which just do specialized parsing before storing the value as a primitive.

You can register fields using the ``register_field_type`` static method in XFormField.  The Coordinate (geopoint) field is actually implemented in this way, using the following code::

    def create_geopoint(command, value):
        """
        Used by our arbitrary field saving / lookup.  This takes the command and the string value representing
        a geolocation and returns a Point location.
        """
        coords = value.split(' ')
        if len(coords) < 2:
           raise ValidationError("+%s parameter must be GPS coordinates in the format 'lat long'" % command)

        for coord in coords[0:2]:
            try:
                test = float(coord)
            except ValueError:
                raise ValidationError("+%s parameter must be GPS coordinates the format 'lat long'" % command)
        
        # lat needs to be between -90 and 90
        if float(coords[0]) < -90 or float(coords[0]) > 90:
            raise ValidationError("+%s parameter has invalid latitude, must be between -90 and 90" % command)
        
        # lng needs to be between -180 and 180
        if float(coords[1]) < -180 or float(coords[1]) > 180:
            raise ValidationError("+%s parameter has invalid longitude, must be between -180 and 180" % command)

        # our cleaned value is the coordinates as a tuple
        cleaned_value = Point.objects.create(latitude=coords[0], longitude=coords[1])
        return cleaned_value

    # register geopoints as a type
    XFormField.register_field_type(XFormField.TYPE_GEOPOINT, 'GPS Coordinate', create_geopoint,
                                   xforms_type='geopoint', db_type=XFormField.TYPE_OBJECT)


Alternatively, you could create a new field type to deal with custom formats.  The following is an example of a custom 'timespan' field which parses time values in formats like '1day' or '6 months', but stores the value in an ordinary integer field representing the number of days::

        def parse_timespan(command, value):
            """
            Parses a timespan object in the format '5days' or '6 months', returning the value as an integer
            of the number of days represented by that timespan.
            """
            match = re.match("(\d+)\W*months?", value, re.IGNORECASE)
            if match:
                return int(match.group(1))*30
            match = re.match("(\d+)\W*days?", value, re.IGNORECASE)
            if match:
                return int(match.group(1))

            raise ValidationError("%s parameter value of '%s' is not a valid timespan." % (command, value))

        XFormField.register_field_type('timespan', 'Timespan', parse_timespan, 
                                       xforms_type='string', db_type=XFormField.TYPE_INT)



Field Constraints
==================

Every field can have one or more ordered constraints applied to it.  For each constraint you can specify a custom error message that is returned if the constraint fails.

The types of constraints are:

``required``
	a non empty value is required for all form submission

``min_value``
	The numeric value of the field must be n or greater.

``max_value``
	The numeric value of the field must be n or less.

``min_len``
	The value as a string must be be at least of length n

``max_len``
	The value as a string must be at most of length n

``regex``
	The value must match the passed in regex.  You likely want to include anchor tokens if the regular expression is meant to be inclusive.

Some example regular expressions::
	
	# only matches the strings 'mal', 'fev' or 'shi'
	^(mal|fev|shi)$

	# matches phone numbers in the form 333-3333
	^\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d$

	# forces the string to be only lowercase letters
	^[a-z]+$
