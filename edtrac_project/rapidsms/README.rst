RapidSMS
========

RapidSMS is a free and open source framework for building interactive SMS applications, which integrates tightly with `Django`_ to provide a rich reporting interface. It was created by the Innovation Team at `UNICEF`_, and is under development by `the RapidSMS Team`_.

Please Note
===========

1) The very old RapidSMS codebase (AKA Tusker) that was living in `rapidsms <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms>`_ **has been moved** to `rapidsms/rapidsms-legacy <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-legacy>`_. If your clone or fork is still in use, you should update your repository's remote/origin.

2) The combined repository of the contents of `rapidsms-core-dev <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-core-dev>`_ and `rapidsms-contrib-apps-dev <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-contrib-apps-dev>`_ **has replaced** the old codebase in `rapidsms <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms>`_.

3) The ``search`` and ``training`` apps that were in `rapidsms-contrib-apps-dev <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-contrib-apps-dev>`_ **have been removed** and are now submodules of `rapidsms-community-apps-dev <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-community-apps-dev>`_.

4) The `rapidsms-core-dev <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-core-dev>`_ and `rapidsms-contrib-apps-dev <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms-contrib-apps-dev>`_ repositories **will remain unchanged** until the 1.0 release, but should now be considered deprecated.

5) The PyPi package will now install from `rapidsms <http://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms>`_.

  This note will be removed from this README once RapidSMS 1.0 arrives.


Installing
==========

RapidSMS is best installed via `PyPi`_. To install the latest stable-ish version::

  $ pip install rapidsms

Alternatively, to install the development version from `GitHub`_::

  $ pip install git+git://github.com/rapidsms/rapidsms.git#egg=RapidSMS

The RapidSMS project skeleton is identical to the Django project skeleton, with a few of our settings added. To quickly spawn a new project, we've bundled a wrapper around django-admin.py::

  $ rapidsms-admin.py startproject myproject

The ``runrouter`` management command starts the router, sends and receives SMS (and other short messages) via the configurable backends::

  $ python manage.py runrouter
